<h1> Work </h1>

<h3>  Black dog ballroom NQ (2015) </h3>

<p> Whilst working at the Black dog company based in the northern quarter, I have learnt some valuable skills, the evolved and trained me as a staff member, to be able to work the tills, and to make sales to customers, this also built up my confidence over time. In the bar, working as part as a team is the main part of hosting the building for customers, it enabled me to learn my team, and to be able to communicate with them efficiently and effectively. </p>

<h3> Countrywide Conveyancing Services (2016/On going) </h3>

<p> Although not well known, Countrywide conveyancing is one of the biggest companies on the conveyancing market. Some of the most valuable skills I have learnt here is my foundation course that took place over the course of a week, gaining a pass. This included the conveyancing legal procedures from start of the transaction to completion, from the side of a property lawyer. Whilst working on New Business team which is an admin role I excelled in learning techniques on the telephone this includes answering legal queries from client, estate agents, and other solicitors thus evolving my customer interaction skills. During the end of 2017 we were implemented with a brand new system, in which I was selected as one of the first people to pilot and test with clients using client and front side online portal where they can fill in documents online. </p>

<h3> (Foundation Courseâ€“ Pass) </h3>

<p> In 2019 I moved internally to the panel team, this new role involved me using my previously learnt skills on the new business team to deal with any questions and escalations for my personal firms. Every month I monitor and track the firms using spreadsheets and set monthly targets, if a firm is underperforming then a conference call is scheduled to discuss any future improvements that can be made. Being on the team for a couple of years now, one of the main skills that I have added is payments. I am one of two members on the team to be trained on payments; this involves being entrusted to send out correct payments to our firms so they can proceed a normal.
