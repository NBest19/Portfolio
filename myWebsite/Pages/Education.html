Level: BSc Horns Bachelor Degree â€“ Achieved a (2/2)  
This course involves studying Web Languages, Website Development, Creative Media and also partaking in group projects. My studies are allowing me to learn new coding languages so that I can develop new techniques to then put into practice. The Creative Media side of the course requires me to edit images, which is allowing me to further my skills in photo editing software such as Photoshop, therefore broadening my experience and skills within ICT systems. The units require me to understand the requirements of a client, and what work can be done to achieve the goal of meeting these requirements, and how this work can be done.
I found the course very interesting, studied units that included extending my knowledge of programmes such as Photoshop, and also coding language such as HTML, CSS and My regular assessments and feedback from lecturers suggest that I will do well in future years of study.
